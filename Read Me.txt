Phone Directory project is a simple phone directory which uses simple File Handling and basic C++ Object Oriented concepts to create basic functions of a phone directory like:
-> Searching for a particular contact.
-> Searching for people in a particular region.
-> Searching for people having a given name.
-> Adding a new contact to the directory.
-> Changing the phone numbers.
-> Deleting an entry.
etc.

Note: This assumes that a people living within a same zip code have distinct name.
